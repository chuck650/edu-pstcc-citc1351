## College Policies

### Syllabus Revision

The course syllabus sets forth the expectations for the course content, work, and grading as well as expectations for student performance and conduct. The syllabus does not constitute a contract between the student and the instructor or the College. The information contained in the syllabus is subject to change at any time. Students will be notified if any changes are made. Though changes are possible, it is expected that the course will be conducted as described in the syllabus.

### Attendance Policy

Students are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled class, laboratory, or clinical sessions. Absences result in missed learning opportunities, lower grades, and, in many cases, failure for the course. Prompt and regular attendance enhances the likelihood of student achievement while also instilling habits that will prepare graduates for success in the workplace.

Each course syllabus will specify attendance requirements and the specific academic consequences entailed by those requirements.

Financial Aid recipients are responsible for meeting attendance requirements for institutional, State and Federal Aid in order to maintain eligibility.

Please see Pellissippi State Policy 03:11:01, Academic Standards, for the complete policy.

### Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct committed either directly or indirectly by an individual or group is subject to disciplinary action. Prohibited activities include but are not limited to the following practices:

- Cheating, including but not limited to unauthorized assistance from material, people, or devices when taking a test, quiz, or examination; writing papers or reports; solving problems; or completing academic assignments.
- Plagiarism, including but not limited to paraphrasing, summarizing, or directly quoting published or unpublished work of another person, including online or computerized services, without proper documentation of the original source.
- Purchasing or otherwise obtaining prewritten essays, research papers, or materials prepared by another person or agency that sells term papers or other academic materials to be presented as one’s own work.
- Taking an exam for another student.
- Providing others with information and/or answers regarding exams, quizzes, homework or other classroom assignments unless explicitly authorized by the instructor.
- Any of the above occurring within the Web or distance learning environment.

Please see the Pellissippi State Policy 04:02:00, Academic/Classroom Conduct and Disciplinary Sanctions for the complete policy.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Students that need accommodations because of a disability, have emergency medical information to share, or need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated should inform the instructor immediately, privately after class or in her or his office. Students must present a current accommodation plan from a staff member in Disability Services (DS) in order to receive accommodations in this course. Disability Services may be contacted via Disability Services email or by visiting Alexander 130.

### Grade Appeal

A student may only appeal a final grade if one or more of the following conditions exist:

- Error in the calculation of the grade

- Substantial deviation from the syllabus

- Clear violation of Pellissippi State Community College and/or the Tennessee Board of Regents policies.

Students have a right to a clear explanation (from the instructor or dean, as appropriate) of actions taken by the instructor, such as how a grade was calculated. An appeal will not be considered because of general dissatisfaction with a grade, penalty, or outcome of a course. Disagreement with the instructor's professional judgement of the quality of the student's work and performance is also not an admissible basis for an academic appeal.

The first step in any appeal is to discuss the situation with the instructor. If no resolution is reached, the student's next step is to consult the dean of the academic department, who may continue the informal process of discussion and/or may inform the student of the process for a formal appeal.

Please see Pellissippi State Policy 03:11:01, Academic Standards, for the complete policy.
