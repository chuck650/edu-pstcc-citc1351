# IT Hardware Proposal Project

**Course**: Introduction to IT Technical Support  
**Instructor**: Charles H. Nelson  
**Objective**: Prepare a professional proposal recommending computer hardware for office and mobile workers across three budget levels.

## Project Overview

As an aspiring IT support technician, you will often be asked to recommend hardware for different types of users. This project simulates a real-world scenario where you must analyze user needs, research hardware options, and present a professional proposal to decision-makers.

You will be given two **user stories**—one for an office worker and one for a mobile worker. Your task is to recommend appropriate hardware for each user across three budget levels. You must justify your choices, compare alternatives, and present a clear recommendation.
