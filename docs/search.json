The syllabus does not constitute a contract between the student and the instructor or the College. The information contained in the syllabus is subject to change at any time. Students will be notified if any changes are made. Though changes are possible, it is expected that the course will be conducted as described in the syllabus.\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled class, laboratory, or clinical sessions. Absences result in missed learning opportunities, lower grades, and, in many cases, failure for the course. Prompt and regular attendance enhances the likelihood of student achievement while also instilling habits that will prepare graduates for success in the workplace.\nEach course syllabus will specify attendance requirements and the specific academic consequences entailed by those requirements.\nFinancial Aid recipients are responsible for meeting attendance requirements for institutional, State and Federal Aid in order to maintain eligibility.\nPlease see Pellissippi State Policy 03:11:01, Academic Standards, for the complete policy.\n\n\n\nAcademic misconduct committed either directly or indirectly by an individual or group is subject to disciplinary action. Prohibited activities include but are not limited to the following practices:\n\nCheating, including but not limited to unauthorized assistance from material, people, or devices when taking a test, quiz, or examination; writing papers or reports; solving problems; or completing academic assignments.\nPlagiarism, including but not limited to paraphrasing, summarizing, or directly quoting published or unpublished work of another person, including online or computerized services, without proper documentation of the original source.\nPurchasing or otherwise obtaining prewritten essays, research papers, or materials prepared by another person or agency that sells term papers or other academic materials to be presented as one’s own work.\nTaking an exam for another student.\nProviding others with information and/or answers regarding exams, quizzes, homework or other classroom assignments unless explicitly authorized by the instructor.\nAny of the above occurring within the Web or distance learning environment.\n\nPlease see the Pellissippi State Policy 04:02:00, Academic/Classroom Conduct and Disciplinary Sanctions for the complete policy.\n\n\n\nStudents that need accommodations because of a disability, have emergency medical information to share, or need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated should inform the instructor immediately, privately after class or in her or his office. Students must present a current accommodation plan from a staff member in Disability Services (DS) in order to receive accommodations in this course. Disability Services may be contacted via Disability Services email or by visiting Alexander 130.\n\n\n\nA student may only appeal a final grade if one or more of the following conditions exist:\n\nError in the calculation of the grade\nSubstantial deviation from the syllabus\nClear violation of Pellissippi State Community College and/or the Tennessee Board of Regents policies.\n\nStudents have a right to a clear explanation (from the instructor or dean, as appropriate) of actions taken by the instructor, such as how a grade was calculated. An appeal will not be considered because of general dissatisfaction with a grade, penalty, or outcome of a course. Disagreement with the instructor’s professional judgement of the quality of the student’s work and performance is also not an admissible basis for an academic appeal.\nThe first step in any appeal is to discuss the situation with the instructor. If no resolution is reached, the student’s next step is to consult the dean of the academic department, who may continue the informal process of discussion and/or may inform the student of the process for a formal appeal.\nPlease see Pellissippi State Policy 03:11:01, Academic Standards, for the complete policy.\n\n\n\nPellissippi State affirms that it will not tolerate discrimination or harassment against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, creed, ethnic or national origin, sex, pregnancy, disability, age (40+), status as a covered veteran, genetic information, nor any other category protected by federal or state civil rights law related to the College.\nSimilarly, the College will not subject any student to discrimination or harassment under any educational program and no student shall be discriminatorily excluded from participation nor denied the benefits of any educational program on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, ethnic or national origin, sex, pregnancy, disability, age (40+), status as a covered veteran, genetic information, or other category protected by federal or state civil rights law related to the College.\nAny Pellissippi State employee, applicant, or student who has reason to feel that they have been harassed or affected by discrimination, or who has any other concerns or questions about equal opportunity, should contact the following:\nExecutive Director of Institutional Compliance Title IX Coordinator/Equity Officer/Title VI Officer/ADA Officer/ Pellissippi State Community College Goins Administration Building, Room 258 10915 Hardin Valley Road P.O.

The syllabus does not constitute a contract between the student and the instructor or the College. The information contained in the syllabus is subject to change at any time. Students will be notified if any changes are made. Though changes are possible, it is expected that the course will be conducted as described in the syllabus.\n\n\n\nStudents are expected to attend and participate in all scheduled class, laboratory, or clinical sessions. Absences result in missed learning opportunities, lower grades, and, in many cases, failure for the course. Prompt and regular attendance enhances the likelihood of student achievement while also instilling habits that will prepare graduates for success in the workplace.\nEach course syllabus will specify attendance requirements and the specific academic consequences entailed by those requirements.\nFinancial Aid recipients are responsible for meeting attendance requirements for institutional, State and Federal Aid in order to maintain eligibility.\nPlease see Pellissippi State Policy 03:11:01, Academic Standards, for the complete policy.\n\n\n\nAcademic misconduct committed either directly or indirectly by an individual or group is subject to disciplinary action. Prohibited activities include but are not limited to the following practices:\n\nCheating, including but not limited to unauthorized assistance from material, people, or devices when taking a test, quiz, or examination; writing papers or reports; solving problems; or completing academic assignments.\nPlagiarism, including but not limited to paraphrasing, summarizing, or directly quoting published or unpublished work of another person, including online or computerized services, without proper documentation of the original source.\nPurchasing or otherwise obtaining prewritten essays, research papers, or materials prepared by another person or agency that sells term papers or other academic materials to be presented as one’s own work.\nTaking an exam for another student.\nProviding others with information and/or answers regarding exams, quizzes, homework or other classroom assignments unless explicitly authorized by the instructor.\nAny of the above occurring within the Web or distance learning environment.\n\nPlease see the Pellissippi State Policy 04:02:00, Academic/Classroom Conduct and Disciplinary Sanctions for the complete policy.\n\n\n\nStudents that need accommodations because of a disability, have emergency medical information to share, or need special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated should inform the instructor immediately, privately after class or in her or his office. Students must present a current accommodation plan from a staff member in Disability Services (DS) in order to receive accommodations in this course. Disability Services may be contacted via Disability Services email or by visiting Alexander 130.\n\n\n\nA student may only appeal a final grade if one or more of the following conditions exist:\n\nError in the calculation of the grade\nSubstantial deviation from the syllabus\nClear violation of Pellissippi State Community College and/or the Tennessee Board of Regents policies.\n\nStudents have a right to a clear explanation (from the instructor or dean, as appropriate) of actions taken by the instructor, such as how a grade was calculated. An appeal will not be considered because of general dissatisfaction with a grade, penalty, or outcome of a course. Disagreement with the instructor’s professional judgement of the quality of the student’s work and performance is also not an admissible basis for an academic appeal.\nThe first step in any appeal is to discuss the situation with the instructor. If no resolution is reached, the student’s next step is to consult the dean of the academic department, who may continue the informal process of discussion and/or may inform the student of the process for a formal appeal.\nPlease see Pellissippi State Policy 03:11:01, Academic Standards, for the complete policy.\n\n\n\nPellissippi State affirms that it will not tolerate discrimination or harassment against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, creed, ethnic or national origin, sex, pregnancy, disability, age (40+), status as a covered veteran, genetic information, nor any other category protected by federal or state civil rights law related to the College.\nSimilarly, the College will not subject any student to discrimination or harassment under any educational program and no student shall be discriminatorily excluded from participation nor denied the benefits of any educational program on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, ethnic or national origin, sex, pregnancy, disability, age (40+), status as a covered veteran, genetic information, or other category protected by federal or state civil rights law related to the College.\nAny Pellissippi State employee, applicant, or student who has reason to feel that they have been harassed or affected by discrimination, or who has any other concerns or questions about equal opportunity, should contact the following:\nExecutive Director of Institutional Compliance Title IX Coordinator/Equity Officer/Title VI Officer/ADA Officer/ Pellissippi State Community College Goins Administration Building, Room 258 10915 Hardin Valley Road P.O.
